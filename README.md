## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
  - Windows: Docker Desktop for Windows
  - macOS: Docker Desktop for Mac
  - Linux: Docker Engine ([Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HammerGPT/Hyper-Alpha-Arena.git
cd Hyper-Alpha-Arena

# Start the application (choose one command based on your Docker version)
docker compose up -d --build        # For newer Docker Desktop (recommended)
# OR
docker-compose up -d --build       # For older Docker versions or standalone docker-compose
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:8802**

### Managing the Application

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f        # (or docker-compose logs -f)

# Stop the application
docker compose down          # (or docker-compose down)

# Restart the application
docker compose restart       # (or docker-compose restart)

# Update to latest version
git pull origin main
docker compose up -d --build # (or docker-compose up -d --build)
```

**Important Notes:**
- All data (databases, configurations, trading history) is persisted in Docker volumes
- Data will be preserved when you stop/restart containers
- Only `docker-compose down -v` will delete data (don't use `-v` flag unless you want to reset everything)

## First-Time Setup

### For Paper Trading (Risk-Free Testing)

1. Open http://localhost:8802
2. Navigate to **AI Traders** section
3. Create your first AI trader:
   - Name: e.g., "GPT-5 Trader"
   - Model: Select from dropdown (gpt-5-mini, claude-sonnet-4.5, etc.)
   - API Key: Your OpenAI/Anthropic/Deepseek API key
   - Base URL: Leave default or use custom endpoint
4. Configure trading strategy:
   - Trigger Mode: Real-time (recommended for active trading)
   - Enable Strategy: Toggle to activate
5. Monitor logs in **System Logs** section to verify setup

### For Hyperliquid Real Trading (⚠️ Use with Caution)

**Prerequisites:**
- A Hyperliquid account with API access
- Your private key (starts with 0x...)
- Test funds in testnet OR real funds in mainnet

**Step 1: Get Your Hyperliquid Private Key**

1. **Testnet (Recommended for Testing)**:
   - Visit: https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/
   - Create an account and export your private key
   - Request testnet funds from the faucet

2. **Mainnet (Real Money)**:
   - Visit: https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/
   - Create an account or use existing wallet
   - Export your private key from your wallet
   - ⚠️ **WARNING**: This is your real money wallet - keep private key secure!

**Step 2: Configure Wallets for AI Trader**

1. Open http://localhost:8802
2. Navigate to **AI Traders** section in the sidebar
3. Create or select an existing AI Trader
4. Scroll down to **Hyperliquid Wallets** section
5. You'll see two wallet configuration panels:
   - **Testnet Wallet**: For paper trading (risk-free)
   - **Mainnet Wallet**: For real trading (real funds)
6. For each wallet you want to configure:
   - Enter your Hyperliquid private key (will be encrypted and stored securely)
   - Set maximum leverage (1-50x, recommended: 3x for testing, 5x for mainnet)
   - Set default leverage (1-3x recommended)
   - Click **Save Wallet**
7. Your wallet address will be automatically parsed from the private key
8. Balance information will load automatically after configuration

**Step 3: Set Global Trading Mode**

1. Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar) or **Hyperliquid** page
2. Find the **Global Trading Environment** section
3. Choose your mode:
   - **TESTNET**: All AI Traders will use their testnet wallets (recommended for initial testing)
   - **MAINNET**: All AI Traders will use their mainnet wallets (⚠️ REAL MONEY)
4. Confirm the switch (especially important when switching to mainnet)

**Step 4: Enable Auto Trading**

1. In your AI Trader configuration
2. Toggle **Auto Trading** to ON
3. Configure trading strategy:
   - Trigger Mode: Real-time (recommended for active trading)
   - Trigger Interval: 60-150 seconds
   - Price Threshold: 0.5-2.0%
4. Choose appropriate **Prompt Template**: "Hyperliquid Pro" includes leverage education
5. Monitor initial trades carefully in **System Logs**

**Safety Tips:**
- ✅ Always test on testnet first with at least 1 week of observation
- ✅ Start with low leverage (1x-3x) until you understand the system
- ✅ Monitor margin usage regularly - liquidations can happen fast
- ✅ Use stop-loss in your AI prompts to limit downside risk
- ❌ Never use maximum leverage (50x) - extremely high liquidation risk
- ❌ Don't leave trading unmonitored for extended periods

## Supported Models

Hyper Alpha Arena supports any OpenAI API compatible language model. **For best results, we recommend using Deepseek** for its cost-effectiveness and strong performance in trading scenarios.

Supported models include:
- **Deepseek** (Recommended): Excellent cost-performance ratio for trading decisions
- **OpenAI**: GPT-5 series, o1 series, GPT-4o, GPT-4
- **Anthropic**: Claude (via compatible endpoints)
- **Custom APIs**: Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

The platform automatically handles model-specific configurations and parameter differences.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Port 8802 already in use
**Solution**:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Problem**: Cannot connect to Docker daemon
**Solution**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running

**Problem**: Database connection errors
**Solution**: Wait for PostgreSQL container to be healthy (check with `docker-compose ps`)

**Problem**: Want to reset all data
**Solution**:
```bash
docker-compose down -v  # This will delete all data!
docker-compose up -d --build
```
